"""Shared models used across the engine, evaluator, and HTTP layer.

The ``Runner`` dataclass lives in :mod:`rules` (copied verbatim from
charles-ascot/lay-engine). This module adds:

* :class:`MarketSnapshot` — the input to :func:`evaluator.evaluate`.
* :class:`EvaluationResult` — the output of :func:`evaluator.evaluate`.
* :class:`SettledBet` — one row of the daily settled-results file.

By design these are all plain dataclasses (no Pydantic). The portal
serialises them via ``to_dict()``; the evaluator is a pure function.
